1、Git learning note
Git learning note：
1\Note:all your operate must be in your target document
2\if it's the first time you commit the  target document, maybe you should initialize your target document.
you should use  “git init “ initialize your target document fist
3\” git add . ” means add all the subfile  in your target document
4\” git status” means confirm the status of your add
5\“git commit -m “type your commit note” ” means submitting the target document  
6\if its the first time you commit this target document ,you should build a connection with your Github repository, the command line is “git remote add origin “url of your Github repository””(maybe sometimes you have wrong, you can have a try with this line “git pull origin master —allow-unrelated-histories”)
7\”git pull origin master”means before you commit the target document, you’d  better pull the code from your Github repository to your local target document
8\now, you can really push your document to your Github repository, command line is “git push -u origin master”
9\down
ps:if it's the fist time you use Git and Github ,maybe you should do some other prepare works, such as set the ssh key
